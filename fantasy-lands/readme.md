## Sample outputs

A cathedral made of wood at the north pole, inhabited by devious penguins, ruled by Lady Gaga, where the main cause of death is constipation.

A settlement made of small people stacked on top of each other on the Moon, inhabited by barbarians, ruled by the communists, where everyone is insane.

A country made of fishing nets in the post apocalyptic wilderness, inhabited by Muppets, ruled by Bono, where the only language is dance.
